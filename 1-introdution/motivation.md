Take-away messages:

* We consider Neural Networks as functions, i.e. they map some input onto some output
* Given human and animal capabilities, we assume that at least biological Neural Networks are able to map a vast variety of inputs to a similar variety of outputs
* We have a quite good understanding of how biological neurons work
* Goal: Let's get a computational model of neurons
